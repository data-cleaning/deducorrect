version 1.0-2
- correctSigns has more thorough argument checking. Variables in flip or swap, not occuring in rules are removed.
- Test for unimodularity of editmatrix in correctRounding can optionally be turned off.
- fixed a bug in correctRounding causing inequality violations in certain cases (Thanks to Kenneth Chin-A-Fat)
- passing argument Q to correctRoundings now emits error
